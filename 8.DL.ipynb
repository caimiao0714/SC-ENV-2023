Intended for both ML beginners and experts, AutoGluon enables you to:\n",
        "  + Quickly prototype deep learning and classical ML solutions for your raw data with a few lines of code.\n",

To bring the best of these two worlds together, we developed Auto-PyTorch, which jointly and robustly optimizes the network architecture and the training hyperparameters to enable fully automated deep learning (AutoDL).\n",
